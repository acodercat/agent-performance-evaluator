def calculate_magnetic_field_strength(current, distance, permeability=None):
	"""
	Calculate the magnetic field strength at a point a certain distance away from a long wire carrying a current.    
	Parameters:
	current: The current flowing through the wire in Amperes.
	distance: The perpendicular distance from the wire to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated.
	permeability: The permeability of the medium. Default is 12.57e-7 (Vacuum Permeability).
