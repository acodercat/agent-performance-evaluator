	"""
	generate_DNA_sequence : Generate a random DNA sequence with a specific length and nucleotide preference.    
	Parameters:
	length (int): The length of the DNA sequence to be generated.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	preferences (List[str]): Preferred nucleotides to include more frequently in the DNA sequence.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [length,preferences,]
