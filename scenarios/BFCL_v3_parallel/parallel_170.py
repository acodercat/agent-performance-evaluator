	"""
	calculate_compound_interest : Calculate compound interest for an initial principal amount.    
	Parameters:
	principal (int): The principal amount that the interest is applied to.

If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [principal,rate,time,]
