	calculate_displacement : Calculates the displacement of an object in motion given initial velocity, time, and acceleration.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity (int): The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
	time (int): The time in seconds that the object has been in motion.
	acceleration (float): The acceleration of the object in m/s^2.

	Required Parameter = [initial_velocity,time,]
