	"""
	linear_regression_get_r_squared : Calculate the coefficient of determination of a regression model.    
	Parameters:
	dataset_path (str): Path to the CSV dataset file.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	independent_variables (List[str]): The independent variables to use in the regression model.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	dependent_variable (str): The dependent variable to predict in the regression model.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [dataset_path,independent_variables,dependent_variable,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
