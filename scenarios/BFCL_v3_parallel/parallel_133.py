	"""
	calculate_distance : Calculate the distance between two GPS coordinates.    
	Parameters:
	coord1 (Tuple[float]): The first coordinate as (latitude, longitude).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	coord2 (Tuple[float]): The second coordinate as (latitude, longitude).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	unit (str): The unit of distance. Defaults to miles if not specified.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [coord1,coord2,unit,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
