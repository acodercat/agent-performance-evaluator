	integrate : Calculate the area under a curve for a specified function between two x values.    
	Parameters:
	function (str): The function to integrate, represented as a string. For example, 'x^3'
	start_x (int): The starting x-value to integrate over.
	end_x (int): The ending x-value to integrate over.
	method (str): The method of numerical integration to use. Choices are 'trapezoid' or 'simpson'. Default is 'trapezoid'.

	Required Parameter = [function,start_x,end_x,]
