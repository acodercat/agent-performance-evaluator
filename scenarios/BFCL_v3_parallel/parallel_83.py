	"""
	final_velocity : Calculate the final velocity of an object given its initial velocity, acceleration, and time.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity (int): The initial velocity of the object in meters/second.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	acceleration (int): The acceleration of the object in meters/second^2.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	time (int): The time over which the acceleration is applied in seconds.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [initial_velocity,acceleration,time,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
