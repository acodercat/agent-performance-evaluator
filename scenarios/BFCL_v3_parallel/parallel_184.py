	algebra_quadratic_roots : Find the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.    
	Parameters:
	a (int): Coefficient of x^2.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	b (int): Coefficient of x.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	c (int): Constant term.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [a,b,c,]
