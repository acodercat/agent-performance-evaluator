	calculate_magnetic_field : Calculate the magnetic field produced at the center of a circular loop carrying current.    
	Parameters:
	current (int): The current through the circular loop in Amperes.
	radius (float): The radius of the circular loop in meters.
	permeability (int): The magnetic permeability. Default is permeability in free space.

	Required Parameter = [current,radius,]
