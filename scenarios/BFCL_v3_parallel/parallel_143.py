	"""
	calc_area_triangle : Calculate the area of a triangle with the formula area = 0.5 * base * height.    
	Parameters:
	base (int): The length of the base of the triangle in meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	height (int): The perpendicular height of the triangle from the base to the opposite vertex in meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [base,height,]
