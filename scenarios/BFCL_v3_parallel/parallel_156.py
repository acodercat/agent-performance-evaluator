	"""
	random_forest_train : Train a Random Forest Model on given data    
	Parameters:
	n_estimators (int): The number of trees in the forest.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	max_depth (int): The maximum depth of the tree.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	data (str): The training data for the model.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [n_estimators,max_depth,data,]
