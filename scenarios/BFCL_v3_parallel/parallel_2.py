	"""
	calculate_resistance : Calculate the resistance of a wire using resistivity, length, and cross-sectional area.    
	Parameters:
	length (int): The length of the wire in meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	area (float): The cross-sectional area of the wire in square meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	resistivity (str): Resistivity of the material (Default: 'copper'). Allowed values: 'copper', 'aluminum'
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [length,area,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
