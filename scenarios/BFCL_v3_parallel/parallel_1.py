	"""
	calculate_em_force : Calculate the induced electromagnetic force based on Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, given the magnetic field (in Tesla), change in magnetic field area (in square meters), and the change in time (in seconds).    
	Parameters:
	b_field (int): The magnetic field in Tesla.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	area (int): The change in area of magnetic field in square meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	d_time (int): The change in time in seconds.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [b_field,area,d_time,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
