def calculate_em_force(b_field, area, d_time):
	"""
	Calculate the induced electromagnetic force based on Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, given the magnetic field (in Tesla), change in magnetic field area (in square meters), and the change in time (in seconds).    
	Parameters:
	b_field: The magnetic field in Tesla.
	area: The change in area of magnetic field in square meters.
	d_time: The change in time in seconds.
