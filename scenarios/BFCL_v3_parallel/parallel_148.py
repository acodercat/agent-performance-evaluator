	"""
	calculate_speed : Calculate the speed of an object based on the distance travelled and the time taken.    
	Parameters:
	distance (int): The distance the object travelled in meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	time (int): The time it took for the object to travel in seconds.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	to_unit (str): The unit in which the speed should be calculated, default is m/s.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [distance,time,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
