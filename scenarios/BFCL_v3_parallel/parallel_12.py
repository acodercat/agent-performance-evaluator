	"""
	model_DecisionTreeClassifier : Build a Decision Tree Classifier model with provided criteria    
	Parameters:
	criterion (str): The function to measure the quality of a split, either 'gini' for the Gini impurity or 'entropy' for the information gain.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	max_depth (int): The maximum depth of the tree, specifying how deep the tree can be.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	random_state (int): Controls the randomness of the estimator
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [criterion,max_depth,random_state,]
