	"""
	mutation_type_find : Finds the type of a genetic mutation based on its SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) ID.    
	Parameters:
	snp_id (str): The ID of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) mutation.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	species (str): Species in which the SNP occurs, default is 'Homo sapiens' (Humans).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [snp_id,]

	return 'Success'
