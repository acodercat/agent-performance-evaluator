	"""
	number_theory_gcd : Compute the greatest common divisor of two given integers.    
	Parameters:
	number1 (int): The first integer.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	number2 (int): The second integer.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [number1,number2,]
