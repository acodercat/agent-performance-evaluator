	"""
	geometry_area_triangle : Calculate the area of a triangle.    
	Parameters:
	base (int): The length of the base of the triangle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	height (int): The height of the triangle from the base.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	unit (str): The measurement unit for the area. Defaults to square meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [base,height,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
