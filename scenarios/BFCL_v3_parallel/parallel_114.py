	"""
	analyze_dna_sequence : Analyzes the DNA sequence based on a reference sequence and return any potential mutations.    
	Parameters:
	sequence (str): The DNA sequence to be analyzed.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	reference_sequence (str): The reference DNA sequence.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	mutation_type (str): Type of the mutation to be looked for in the sequence.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [sequence,reference_sequence,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
