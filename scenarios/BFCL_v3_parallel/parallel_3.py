	protein_info_get_sequence_and_3D : Retrive the sequence and 3D models of proteins.    
	Parameters:
	protein_name (str): The name of the protein.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	model_3d (bool): Set true to get 3D model of the protein.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
