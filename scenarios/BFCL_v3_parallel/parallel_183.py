def math_hypot(x:int, y:int, z:int=None) -> str:
	"""
	math_hypot : Calculate the Euclidean norm, sqrt(sum(squares)), the length of the vector from the origin to point (x, y) which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.    
	Parameters:
	x (int): The x-coordinate value.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	y (int): The y-coordinate value.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	z (int): Optional. The z-coordinate value. Default is 0.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [x,y,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
