	kinematics_final_velocity_from_distance : Calculate the final velocity of an object given the acceleration and distance travelled, assuming initial velocity is 0.    
	Parameters:
	acceleration (int): Acceleration of the object, m/s^2.
	distance (int): Distance traveled by the object, m.
	initial_velocity (int): Initial velocity of the object. Default is 0, m/s

	Required Parameter = [acceleration,distance,]
