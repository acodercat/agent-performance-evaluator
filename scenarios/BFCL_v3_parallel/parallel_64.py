def solve_quadratic(a, b, c, root_type=None):
	"""
	Solve a quadratic equation given coefficients a, b, and c. If optional 'root_type' is 'real', the function will only return real roots. If not specified, function may return complex roots.    
	Parameters:
	a: The coefficient of the squared term in the quadratic equation.
	b: The coefficient of the linear term in the quadratic equation.
	c: The constant term in the quadratic equation.
	root_type: The type of roots to return: 'real' for real roots, 'all' for both real and complex roots. This parameter is optional. default is 'all'
