	"""
	calculate_electric_field_strength : Calculate the electric field strength at a certain distance from a point charge.    
	Parameters:
	charge (int): The charge in Coulombs.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	distance (float): The distance from the charge in meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	medium (str): The medium in which the charge and the point of calculation is located. Default is 'vacuum'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [charge,distance,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
