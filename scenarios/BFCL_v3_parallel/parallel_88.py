	"""
	calculate_final_speed : Calculate the final speed of an object dropped from a certain height without air resistance.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity (int): The initial velocity of the object.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	height (int): The height from which the object is dropped.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	gravity (float): The gravitational acceleration. Default is 9.8 m/s^2.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [initial_velocity,height,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
