	"""
	confidence_interval_calculate : Calculate the confidence interval for a mean.    
	Parameters:
	sample_std_dev (int): The standard deviation of the sample.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	sample_size (int): The size of the sample.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	sample_mean (int): The mean of the sample.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	confidence_level (float): The level of confidence. Default is 0.9.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [sample_std_dev,sample_size,sample_mean,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
