	"""
	calculus_derivative : Compute the derivative of a function at a specific value.    
	Parameters:
	function (str): The function to calculate the derivative of.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	value (int): The value where the derivative needs to be calculated at.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	function_variable (str): The variable present in the function, for instance x or y, etc.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [function,value,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
