	"""
	calculate_final_temperature : Calculates the final equilibrium temperature after mixing two bodies with different masses and temperatures    
	Parameters:
	mass1 (int): The mass of the first body (kg).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	temperature1 (int): The initial temperature of the first body (Celsius).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	mass2 (int): The mass of the second body (kg).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	temperature2 (int): The initial temperature of the second body (Celsius).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	specific_heat_capacity (float): The specific heat capacity of the bodies in kJ/kg/K. If not provided, will default to that of water at room temperature, which is 4.2 kJ/kg/K.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
