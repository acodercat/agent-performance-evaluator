	"""
	calculate_emissions : Calculates the annual carbon dioxide emissions produced by a vehicle based on the distance traveled, the fuel type and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.    
	Parameters:
	distance (int): The distance travelled in miles.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	fuel_type (str): Type of fuel used by the vehicle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	fuel_efficiency (float): The vehicle's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	efficiency_reduction (int): The percentage decrease in fuel efficiency per year (optional). Default is 0
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [distance,fuel_type,fuel_efficiency,]
