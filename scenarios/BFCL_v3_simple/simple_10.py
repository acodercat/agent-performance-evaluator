	"""
	calculate_area : Calculate the area of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of its base and height.    
	Parameters:
	base (int): The length of the base of the right-angled triangle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	height (int): The height of the right-angled triangle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	unit (str): The unit of measure used. Defaults to 'cm'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [base,height,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
