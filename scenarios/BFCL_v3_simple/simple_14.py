	"""
	calculate_derivative : Calculate the derivative of a polynomial function.    
	Parameters:
	function (str): The polynomial function.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	x_value (float): The x-value at which the derivative is calculated. Optional, default to 0.00.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [function,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
