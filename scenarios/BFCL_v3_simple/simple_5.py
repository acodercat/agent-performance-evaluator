	"""
	solve_quadratic : Solve a quadratic equation given coefficients a, b, and c. If optional 'root_type' is 'real', the function will only return real roots. If not specified, function may return complex roots.    
	Parameters:
	a (int): The coefficient of the squared term in the quadratic equation.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	b (int): The coefficient of the linear term in the quadratic equation.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	c (int): The constant term in the quadratic equation.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	root_type (str): The type of roots to return: 'real' for real roots, 'all' for both real and complex roots. Default value is 'real'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [a,b,c,]
