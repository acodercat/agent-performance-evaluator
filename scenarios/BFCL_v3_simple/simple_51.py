	"""
	calculate_entropy_change : Calculate the entropy change for an isothermal and reversible process.    
	Parameters:
	initial_temp (int): The initial temperature in Kelvin.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	final_temp (int): The final temperature in Kelvin.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	heat_capacity (int): The heat capacity in J/K.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	isothermal (bool): Whether the process is isothermal. Default is True.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [initial_temp,final_temp,heat_capacity,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
