	"""
	solve_quadratic_equation : Function solves the quadratic equation and returns its roots.    
	Parameters:
	a (int): Coefficient of x squared
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	b (int): Coefficient of x
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	c (int): Constant term in the quadratic equation.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [a,b,c,]

	"""
