	"""
	calc_absolute_pressure : Calculates the absolute pressure from gauge and atmospheric pressures.    
	Parameters:
	atm_pressure (int): The atmospheric pressure in atmospheres (atm). Default is 1 atm if not provided.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	gauge_pressure (int): The gauge pressure in atmospheres (atm). Must be provided.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [gauge_pressure,]
