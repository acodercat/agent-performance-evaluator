	"""
	calculate_binomial_probability : Calculates the binomial probability given the number of trials, successes and the probability of success on an individual trial.    
	Parameters:
	number_of_trials (int): The total number of trials.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	number_of_successes (int): The desired number of successful outcomes.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	probability_of_success (float): The probability of a successful outcome on any given trial.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [number_of_trials,number_of_successes,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
