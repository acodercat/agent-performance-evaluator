	electromagnetic_force : Calculate the electromagnetic force between two charges placed at a certain distance.    
	Parameters:
	charge1 (int): The magnitude of the first charge in coulombs.
	charge2 (int): The magnitude of the second charge in coulombs.
	distance (int): The distance between the two charges in meters.
	medium_permittivity (float): The relative permittivity of the medium in which the charges are present. Default is 8.854e-12 (Vacuum Permittivity).
