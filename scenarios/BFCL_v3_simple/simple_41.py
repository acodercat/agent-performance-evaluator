	"""
	electromagnetic_force : Calculate the electromagnetic force between two charges placed at a certain distance.    
	Parameters:
	charge1 (int): The magnitude of the first charge in coulombs.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	charge2 (int): The magnitude of the second charge in coulombs.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	distance (int): The distance between the two charges in meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	medium_permittivity (float): The relative permittivity of the medium in which the charges are present. Default is 8.854e-12 (Vacuum Permittivity).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [charge1,charge2,distance,]
