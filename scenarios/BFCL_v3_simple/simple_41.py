def electromagnetic_force(charge1, charge2, distance, medium_permittivity=None):
	"""
	Calculate the electromagnetic force between two charges placed at a certain distance.    
	Parameters:
	charge1: The magnitude of the first charge in coulombs.
	charge2: The magnitude of the second charge in coulombs.
	distance: The distance between the two charges in meters.
	medium_permittivity: The relative permittivity of the medium in which the charges are present. Default is 8.854e-12 (Vacuum Permittivity).
