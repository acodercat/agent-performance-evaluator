	"""
	cell_biology_function_lookup : Look up the function of a given molecule in a specified organelle.    
	Parameters:
	molecule (str): The molecule of interest.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	organelle (str): The organelle of interest.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	specific_function (bool): If set to true, a specific function of the molecule within the organelle will be provided, if such information exists.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [molecule,organelle,specific_function,]
