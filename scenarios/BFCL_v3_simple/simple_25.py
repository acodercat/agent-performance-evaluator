	"""
	calculate_final_velocity : Calculate the final velocity of a free falling object given the height it's dropped from, the initial velocity and acceleration due to gravity. Ignore air resistance.    
	Parameters:
	height (int): The height the object is dropped from, in meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	initial_velocity (int): The initial velocity of the object in m/s. Default is zero.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	gravity (float): Acceleration due to gravity. Default value is 9.81 m/s^2, earth's gravity.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [height,]

	return 'Success'
