	"""
	calculate_final_velocity : Calculate the final velocity of a free falling object given the height it's dropped from, the initial velocity and acceleration due to gravity. Ignore air resistance.    
	Parameters:
	height (int): The height the object is dropped from, in meters.
	initial_velocity (int): The initial velocity of the object in m/s. Default is zero.
	gravity (float): Acceleration due to gravity. Default value is 9.81 m/s^2, earth's gravity.

	Required Parameter = [height,]
