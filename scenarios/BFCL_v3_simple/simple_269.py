	"""
	calculate_compound_interest : Calculates the compound interest of an investment over a given time period.    
	Parameters:
	principle (int): The initial amount of the investment.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	interest_rate (float): The yearly interest rate of the investment.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	time (int): The time, in years, the money is invested or borrowed for.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	compounds_per_year (int): The number of times the interest is compounded per year. Default is 1 (interest is compounded yearly).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [principle,interest_rate,time,]
