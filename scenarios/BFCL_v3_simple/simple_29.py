def calculate_final_speed(time:int, initial_speed:int=None, gravity:float=None) -> str:
	"""
	calculate_final_speed : Calculate the final speed of an object in free fall after a certain time, neglecting air resistance. The acceleration due to gravity is considered as -9.81 m/s^2    
	Parameters:
	initial_speed (int): The initial speed of the object in m/s. Default is 0 for an object at rest.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	time (int): The time in seconds for which the object is in free fall.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	gravity (float): The acceleration due to gravity. Default is -9.81 m/s^2.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [time,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
