	"""
	kinematics_final_velocity_from_distance : Calculate the final velocity of an object given the acceleration and distance travelled, assuming initial velocity is 0.    
	Parameters:
	acceleration (int): Acceleration of the object, m/s^2.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	distance (int): Distance traveled by the object, m.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	initial_velocity (float): Initial velocity of the object. Default is 0, m/s
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [acceleration,distance,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
