def kinematics_final_velocity_from_distance(acceleration, distance, initial_velocity=None):
	"""
	Calculate the final velocity of an object given the acceleration and distance travelled, assuming initial velocity is 0.    
	Parameters:
	acceleration: Acceleration of the object, m/s^2.
	distance: Distance traveled by the object, m.
	initial_velocity: Initial velocity of the object. Default is 0, m/s
