	"""
	calculate_fitness : Calculate the expected evolutionary fitness of a creature based on the individual values and contributions of its traits.    
	Parameters:
	trait_values (List[float]): List of trait values, which are decimal numbers between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the trait maximally contributing to fitness.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	trait_contributions (List[float]): List of the percentage contributions of each trait to the overall fitness, which must sum to 1.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [trait_values,trait_contributions,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
