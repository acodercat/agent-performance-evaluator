	"""
	calculate_magnetic_field : Calculate the magnetic field produced at the center of a circular loop carrying current.    
	Parameters:
	current (int): The current through the circular loop in Amperes.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	radius (int): The radius of the circular loop in meters.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	permeability (float): The magnetic permeability. Default is 12.57e10 (Vacuum Permeability).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [current,radius,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
