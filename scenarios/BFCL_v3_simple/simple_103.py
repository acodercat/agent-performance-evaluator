	"""
	mathematics_calculate_area_under_curve : Calculate the area under the curve for a given polynomial function within a specified interval.    
	Parameters:
	polynomial (List[float]): The coefficients of the polynomial, in decreasing order of exponent, where the first element is the coefficient for x^n, the second element is the coefficient for x^(n-1), and so on. The last element is the constant term.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	limits (List[float]): A list of two numbers specifying the lower and upper limit for the integration interval.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [polynomial,limits,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
