	"""
	calculate_area_under_curve : Calculate the area under a mathematical function within a given interval.    
	Parameters:
	function (str): The mathematical function as a string.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	interval (List[float]): An array that defines the interval to calculate the area under the curve from the start to the end point.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	method (str): The numerical method to approximate the area under the curve. The default value is 'trapezoidal'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [function,interval,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
