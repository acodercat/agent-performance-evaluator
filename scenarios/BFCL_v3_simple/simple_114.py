	"""
	prob_dist_binomial : Compute the probability of having 'success' outcome from binomial distribution.    
	Parameters:
	trials (int): The number of independent experiments.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	successes (int): The number of success events.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	p (float): The probability of success on any given trial, defaults to 0.5
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [trials,successes,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
