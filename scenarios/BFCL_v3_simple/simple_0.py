	"""
	calculate_triangle_area : Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.    
	Parameters:
	base (int): The base of the triangle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	height (int): The height of the triangle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	unit (str): The unit of measure (defaults to 'units' if not specified)
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [base,height,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
