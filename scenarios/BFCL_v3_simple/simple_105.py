	"""
	math_power : Calculate the power of one number raised to another.    
	Parameters:
	base (int): The base number.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	exponent (int): The exponent.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	mod (int): The modulus. Default is 1. Calculates pow(base, exponent) % mod when provided.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [base,exponent,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
