	"""
	random_normalvariate : Generates a random number from a normal distribution given the mean and standard deviation.    
	Parameters:
	mu (int): Mean of the normal distribution.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	sigma (int): Standard deviation of the normal distribution.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [mu,sigma,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
