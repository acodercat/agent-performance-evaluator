	"""
	prediction_evolution : Predict the evolutionary rate for a specific species for a given timeframe.    
	Parameters:
	species (str): The species that the evolution rate will be predicted for.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	years (int): Number of years for the prediction.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	model (str): The model used to make the prediction, options: 'Darwin', 'Lamarck', default is 'Darwin'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [species,years,]
