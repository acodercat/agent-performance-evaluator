	"""
	light_travel_time : Calculate the time taken for light to travel from a celestial body to another.    
	Parameters:
	distance_in_light_years (int): The distance between the two celestial bodies in light years.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	speed_of_light (int): The speed of light in vacuum, in m/s. Default value is 299792458 m/s.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [distance_in_light_years,]
