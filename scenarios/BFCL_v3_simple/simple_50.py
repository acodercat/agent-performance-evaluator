	entropy_change_calculate : Calculate the change in entropy for a mass of a specific substance under set initial and final conditions.    
	Parameters:
	substance (str): The substance for which the change in entropy is calculated.
	mass (int): The mass of the substance in kg.
	initial_temperature (int): The initial temperature of the substance in degree Celsius.
	final_temperature (int): The final temperature of the substance in degree Celsius.
	pressure (int): The pressure the substance is under in atmospheres.
