	"""
	calculate_compounded_interest : Calculate the compounded interest for a given principal, interest rate, and period.    
	Parameters:
	principal (int): The initial principal.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	period (int): The period in years.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	compounding_frequency (str): The frequency of compounding per year. Defaults to 'Annually'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [principal,interest_rate,period,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
