	"""
	calculate_final_velocity : Calculate the final velocity of an object under constant acceleration, knowing its initial velocity, acceleration, and time of acceleration.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity (int): The initial velocity of the object.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	acceleration (float): The acceleration of the object.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	time (int): The time of acceleration.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [initial_velocity,acceleration,time,]

	"""
