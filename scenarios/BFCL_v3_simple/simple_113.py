	"""
	probability_dice_roll : Calculate the probability of rolling a certain number on a six-sided die a certain number of times in a row.    
	Parameters:
	desired_number (int): The number you want to roll.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	number_of_rolls (int): How many times you want to roll that number in a row.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	die_sides (int): The number of sides on the die (optional; default is 6).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [desired_number,number_of_rolls,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
