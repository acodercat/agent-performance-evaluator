	"""
	calculate_slope_gradient : Calculate the slope gradient between two geographical coordinates.    
	Parameters:
	point1 (List[float]): The geographic coordinates for the first point [Latitude, Longitude].
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	point2 (List[float]): The geographic coordinates for the second point [Latitude, Longitude].
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	unit (str): The unit for the slope gradient. Default is 'degree'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [point1,point2,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
