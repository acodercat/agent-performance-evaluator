	"""
	calculate_molecular_weight : Calculate the molecular weight of a compound given the compound formula.    
	Parameters:
	compound (str): The molecular formula of the compound.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	to_unit (str): The unit in which to return the result.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [compound,to_unit,]
