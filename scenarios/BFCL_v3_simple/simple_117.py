	"""
	probability_of_event : Calculates the probability of an event.    
	Parameters:
	success_outcomes (int): The number of successful outcomes.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	total_outcomes (int): The total number of possible outcomes.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	format_as_ratio (bool): When true, formats the output as a ratio instead of a decimal. Default is false.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [success_outcomes,total_outcomes,]
