	"""
	prime_factorize : Calculate the prime factorization of a given integer.    
	Parameters:
	number (int): The number for which to calculate the prime factorization.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	return_type (str): Determines the format of the returned prime factorization. Can be 'list' for a list of all prime factors or 'dictionary' for a count of each prime factor. Default is 'list'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [number,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
