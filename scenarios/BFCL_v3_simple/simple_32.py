	calculate_final_speed : Calculate the final speed of an object dropped from a certain height without air resistance.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity (int): The initial velocity of the object.
	height (int): The height from which the object is dropped.
	gravity (float): The gravitational acceleration. Default is 9.8 m/s^2.

	Required Parameter = [initial_velocity,height,]
