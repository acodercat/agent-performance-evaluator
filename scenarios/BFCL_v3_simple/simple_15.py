def integrate(function:str, start_x:int, end_x:int, method:str=None) -> str:
	"""
	integrate : Calculate the area under a curve for a specified function between two x values.    
	Parameters:
	function (str): The function to integrate, represented as a string. For example, 'x^3'
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	start_x (int): The starting x-value to integrate over.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	end_x (int): The ending x-value to integrate over.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	method (str): The method of numerical integration to use. Choices are 'trapezoid' or 'simpson'. Default is 'trapezoid'.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [function,start_x,end_x,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
