	"""
	calculate_resonant_frequency : Calculate the resonant frequency of an LC (inductor-capacitor) circuit.    
	Parameters:
	inductance (float): The inductance (L) in henries (H).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	capacitance (float): The capacitance (C) in farads (F).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	round_off (int): Rounding off the result to a certain decimal places, default is 2.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [inductance,capacitance,]
