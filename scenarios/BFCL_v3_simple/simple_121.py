	"""
	calc_binomial_prob : Calculates the probability of an outcome based on the binomial distribution    
	Parameters:
	num_trials (int): Number of independent experiments.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	num_success (int): Number of times the event of interest has occurred.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	prob_success (float): Probability of the event of interest on any single experiment.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [num_trials,num_success,prob_success,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
