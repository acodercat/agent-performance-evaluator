	"""
	calculate_displacement : Calculates the displacement of an object in motion given initial velocity, time, and acceleration.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity (int): The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	time (int): The time in seconds that the object has been in motion.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	acceleration (float): The acceleration of the object in m/s^2.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [initial_velocity,time,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
