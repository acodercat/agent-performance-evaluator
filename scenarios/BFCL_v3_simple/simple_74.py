	"""
	calculate_bacteria_evolution_rate : Calculate the evolution rate of bacteria given the starting number, duplication frequency and total duration.    
	Parameters:
	start_population (int): The starting population of bacteria.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	duplication_frequency (int): The frequency of bacteria duplication per hour.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	duration (int): Total duration in hours.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	generation_time (int): The average generation time of the bacteria in minutes. Default is 20 minutes
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [start_population,duplication_frequency,duration,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
