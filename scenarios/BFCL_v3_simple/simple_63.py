	"""
	genetics_calculate_similarity : Calculates the genetic similarity between two species based on their DNA sequences.    
	Parameters:
	species1 (str): The first species to compare.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	species2 (str): The second species to compare.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	format (str): The format of the result (percentage or fraction). Default is percentage.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [species1,species2,]
