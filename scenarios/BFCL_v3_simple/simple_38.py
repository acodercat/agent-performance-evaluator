	"""
	calculate_electrostatic_potential : Calculate the electrostatic potential between two charged bodies using the principle of Coulomb's Law.    
	Parameters:
	charge1 (float): The quantity of charge on the first body.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	charge2 (float): The quantity of charge on the second body.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	distance (float): The distance between the two bodies.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	constant (float): The value of the electrostatic constant. Default is 8.99e9.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [charge1,charge2,distance,]
