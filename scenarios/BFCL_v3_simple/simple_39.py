	"""
	calculate_electric_field : Calculate the electric field produced by a charge at a certain distance.    
	Parameters:
	charge (int): Charge in coulombs producing the electric field.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	distance (int): Distance from the charge in meters where the field is being measured.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	permitivity (float): Permitivity of the space where field is being calculated, default is 8.854e-12.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [charge,distance,]

	"""
	return 'Success'
