	"""
	Plot a sine wave for a given frequency in a given range.    
	Parameters:
	start_range: Start of the range in radians.
	end_range: End of the range in radians.
	frequency: Frequency of the sine wave in Hz.
	amplitude: Amplitude of the sine wave. Default is 1.
	phase_shift: Phase shift of the sine wave in radians. Default is 0.

def geometry_area_circle(radius, units='meters'):
	"""
	Calculate the area of a circle given the radius.    
	Parameters:
	radius: The radius of the circle.
	units: The units in which the radius is measured (defaults to meters).
