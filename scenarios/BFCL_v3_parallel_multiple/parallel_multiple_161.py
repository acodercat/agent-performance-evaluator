	calculate_cagr : Calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) given an initial investment value, a final investment value, and the number of years.    
	Parameters:
	initial_value (int): The initial investment value.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	final_value (int): The final investment value.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	period_in_years (int): The period of the investment in years.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
