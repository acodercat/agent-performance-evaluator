	"""
	math_toolkit_sum_of_multiples : Find the sum of all multiples of specified numbers within a specified range.    
	Parameters:
	lower_limit (int): The start of the range (inclusive).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	upper_limit (int): The end of the range (inclusive).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	multiples (List[int]): The numbers to find multiples of.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [lower_limit,upper_limit,multiples,]

	"""
	return 'Success'

	math_toolkit_product_of_primes : Find the product of the first n prime numbers.    
	Parameters:
	count (int): The number of prime numbers to multiply together.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
