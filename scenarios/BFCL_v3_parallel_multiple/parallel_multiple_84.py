	"""
	math_sqrt : Calculates the square root of a number.    
	Parameters:
	num (float): The number.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	accuracy (float): The number of decimal places in the result.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [num,]

	math_gcd : Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.    
	Parameters:
	num1 (int): The first number.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	num2 (int): The second number.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
