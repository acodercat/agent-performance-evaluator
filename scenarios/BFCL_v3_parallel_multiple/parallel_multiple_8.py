def kinematics_distance_traveled(initial_velocity, acceleration, time):
	"""
	Computes the total distance covered by a moving object given initial velocity, acceleration and time.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity: The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
	acceleration: The acceleration of the object in m/s^2.
	time: The time for which the object has been moving in seconds.

	"""
	pass

def kinematics_final_velocity(initial_velocity, acceleration, time):
	"""
	Calculates the final velocity of a moving object given initial velocity, acceleration and time.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity: The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
	acceleration: The acceleration of the object in m/s^2.
	time: The time for which the object has been moving in seconds.
