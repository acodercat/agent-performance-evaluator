def kinematics_calculate_acceleration(initial_speed, final_speed, time, distance=0):
	"""
	Calculates the acceleration of an object under given conditions.    
	Parameters:
	initial_speed: The initial speed of the object.
	final_speed: The final speed of the object.
	time: The time in seconds it took the object to reach the final speed.
	distance: The distance in meters the object has traveled.

def kinematics_calculate_speed_from_rest(distance, time, initial_speed=0):
	"""
	Calculates the speed of an object that starts from rest under a constant acceleration over a specified distance.    
	Parameters:
	distance: The distance in meters the object has traveled.
	time: The time in seconds it took the object to travel.
	initial_speed: The initial speed of the object.
