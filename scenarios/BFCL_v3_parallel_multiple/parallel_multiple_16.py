def calculate_fibonacci(position:int) -> str:
	"""
	calculate_fibonacci : Calculate the Fibonacci series up to a specific position.    
	Parameters:
	position (int): The position up to which you want to calculate the Fibonacci series.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [position,]

	"""
	return 'Success'

	"""
	calculate_factorial : Calculate the factorial of a given number.    
	Parameters:
	number (int): The number of which you want to calculate the factorial.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [number,]

	generate_prime : Generate prime numbers within a given range.    
	Parameters:
	start (int): The start of the range from which you want to find the prime numbers.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	end (int): The end of the range from which you want to find the prime numbers.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
