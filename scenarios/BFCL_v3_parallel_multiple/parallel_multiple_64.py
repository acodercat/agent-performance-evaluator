	wildlife_population_assess_growth : Assesses the population growth of a specific species in a specified location over a period.    
	Parameters:
	species (str): The species for which the growth is to be calculated.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	location (str): The area where the species is present.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	duration (int): The time period for which the population growth should be calculated in years.
