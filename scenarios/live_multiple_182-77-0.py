def math_gcd(a, b):
	"""
	Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers.    
	Parameters:
	a: The first non-negative integer for which the GCD is to be computed.
	b: The second non-negative integer for which the GCD is to be computed.

def estimate_derivative(function, x, delta=0.001):
	"""
	Estimate the derivative of a function at a given point using a numerical approximation method.    
	Parameters:
	function: The function of which to calculate the derivative. It should be a single-variable function.
	x: The point at which to calculate the derivative, expressed as a floating-point number.
	delta: The small change in the input of the function used for calculating the derivative. It determines the accuracy of the approximation.
