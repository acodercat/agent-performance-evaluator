	currency_conversion_convert : Convert a value from one currency to another.    
	Parameters:
	amount (int): The amount to be converted.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	from_currency (str): The currency to convert from.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	to_currency (str): The currency to convert to.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Parameters:
	initial_velocity (float): The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	time (float): The time in seconds that the object has been in motion.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
