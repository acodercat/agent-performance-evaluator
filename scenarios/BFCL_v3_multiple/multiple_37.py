def physics_wave_velocity(frequency, wavelength):
	"""
	Calculate the velocity of a wave based on its frequency and wavelength.    
	Parameters:
	frequency: The frequency of the wave in Hz.
	wavelength: The wavelength of the wave in m.

	"""
	pass

def kinematics_final_velocity(initial_velocity, time, acceleration=None):
	"""
	Find the final velocity of an object moving under constant acceleration.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity: The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
	time: The time in seconds the object has been moving.
	acceleration: The acceleration of the object in m/s^2. Default value is -9.81 (Earth's gravity)

	"""
	pass

def kinematics_distance(initial_velocity, time, acceleration=None):
	"""
	Find the distance traveled by an object moving under constant acceleration.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity: The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
	time: The time in seconds the object has been moving.
	acceleration: The acceleration of the object in m/s^2. Default value is -9.81 (Earth's gravity)
