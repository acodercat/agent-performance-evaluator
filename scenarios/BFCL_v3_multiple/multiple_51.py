	"""
	dice_roll_probability : Calculate the probability of a specific sum appearing from rolling two dice.    
	Parameters:
	desired_sum (int): The sum for which to calculate the probability.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	n_rolls (int): Number of dice to be rolled. Default is 1
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	sides_per_die (int): Number of sides on each die.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [desired_sum,sides_per_die,]

	desired_outcome (str): The outcome for which to calculate the probability.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	n_flips (int): Number of coins to be flipped. Default 1
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Parameters:
	desired_card (str): The card for which to calculate the probability.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	n_decks (int): Number of decks to shuffle. Default 1
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
