	"""
	math_triangle_area_heron : Calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula, given the lengths of its three sides.    
	Parameters:
	side1 (int): Length of the first side of the triangle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	side2 (int): Length of the second side of the triangle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	side3 (int): Length of the third side of the triangle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [side1,side2,side3,]
