	"""
	math_gcd : Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers.    
	Parameters:
	num1 (int): First number.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	num2 (int): Second number.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [num1,num2,]

	get_top_cases : Retrieve a list of the most influential or landmark cases in a specific field of law.    
	Parameters:
	field_of_law (str): The specific field of law e.g., constitutional law, criminal law, etc.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	top_number (int): The number of top cases to retrieve.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	country (str): The country where the law cases should be retrieved from. Default is US.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
