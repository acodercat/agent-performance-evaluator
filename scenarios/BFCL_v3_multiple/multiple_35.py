	"""
	calculate_lcm : Calculate the least common multiple (lcm) between two integers.    
	Parameters:
	num1 (int): First number to calculate lcm for.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	num2 (int): Second number to calculate lcm for.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	method (str): The specific method to use in the calculation. Supported values: 'standard', 'reduced'. Default 'standard'
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [num1,num2,]

	calculate_gcd : Calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) between two integers.    
	Parameters:
	num1 (int): First number to calculate gcd for.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	num2 (int): Second number to calculate gcd for.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	algorithm (str): The specific algorithm to use in the calculation. Supported values: 'euclidean', 'binary'. Default 'euclidean'
