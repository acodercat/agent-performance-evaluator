def calculate_mutual_fund_balance(investment_amount:int, annual_yield:float, years:int) -> str:
	"""
	calculate_mutual_fund_balance : Calculate the final balance of a mutual fund investment based on the total initial investment, annual yield rate and the time period.    
	Parameters:
	investment_amount (int): The initial total amount invested in the fund.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	annual_yield (float): The annual yield rate of the fund.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	years (int): The period of time for the fund to mature.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [investment_amount,annual_yield,years,]

	geometry_calculate_area_circle : Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.    
	Parameters:
	radius (float): The radius of the circle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	unit (str): The measurement unit of the radius (optional parameter, default is 'units').
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
