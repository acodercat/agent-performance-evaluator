	"""
	prob_dist_binomial : Compute the probability of having 'success' outcome from binomial distribution.    
	Parameters:
	trials (int): The number of independent experiments.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	successes (int): The number of success events.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	p (float): The probability of success on any given trial, defaults to 0.5
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [trials,successes,]

	Parameters:
	coverage_rate (int): The area in square feet that one gallon of paint can cover.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	length (int): Length of the wall to be painted in feet.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
