	"""
	geometry_area_circle : Calculate the area of a circle given the radius.    
	Parameters:
	radius (int): The radius of the circle.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	units (str): The units in which the radius is measured (defaults to meters).
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [radius,]

	"""
	return 'Success'

	"""
	plot_sine_wave : Plot a sine wave for a given frequency in a given range.    
	Parameters:
	start_range (float): Start of the range in radians.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	end_range (float): End of the range in radians.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	frequency (float): Frequency of the sine wave in Hz.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	amplitude (float): Amplitude of the sine wave. Default is 1.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	phase_shift (float): Phase shift of the sine wave in radians. Default is 0.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [start_range,end_range,frequency,]
