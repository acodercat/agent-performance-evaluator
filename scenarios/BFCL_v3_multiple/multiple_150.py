	"""
	calculate_electrostatic_potential : Calculate the electrostatic potential between two charged bodies using the principle of Coulomb's Law.    
	Parameters:
	charge1 (float): The quantity of charge on the first body.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	charge2 (float): The quantity of charge on the second body.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	distance (float): The distance between the two bodies.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	constant (float): The value of the electrostatic constant. Default is 898755178.73

	"""
	calculate_neuronal_activity : Calculate the neuronal activity (rate of firing) based on a given input synaptic rate, weight of inputs, and decay rate. Higher input or weight increases firing rate and higher decay rate decreases it.    
	Parameters:
	input_synaptic_rate (int): The synaptic input rate, usually represented as number of inputs per second.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	weight (float): The weight of the input, denoting its influence on the neuron's state. Default is 1.0.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	decay_rate (float): The rate at which the neuron's potential decays in the absence of inputs.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	calculate_displacement : Calculates the displacement of an object in motion given initial velocity, time, and acceleration.    
	Parameters:
	initial_velocity (float): The initial velocity of the object in m/s.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	time (int): The time in seconds that the object has been in motion.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
