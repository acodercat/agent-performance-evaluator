	"""
	historical_contrib_get_contrib : Retrieve historical contribution made by a scientist on a specific date.    
	Parameters:
	scientist (str): The scientist whose contributions need to be searched.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	date (str): The date when the contribution was made in yyyy-mm-dd format.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	category (str): The field of the contribution, such as 'Physics' or 'Chemistry'. Default is all fields.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.

	Required Parameter = [scientist,date,]

	music_calculate_note_duration : Calculate the duration between two notes based on their frequencies and harmonic rhythm.    
	Parameters:
	first_note_frequency (float): The frequency of the first note in Hz.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	second_note_frequency (float): The frequency of the second note in Hz.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
	tempo (int): The tempo of the music in beats per minute. Defaults to 120 beats per minute.
If you got 'Success' as the return value, it means the function calling is success, you dont need to modify to get the return.
