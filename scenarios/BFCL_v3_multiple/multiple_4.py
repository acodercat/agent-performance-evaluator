	kinematics_calculate_displacement : Calculate displacement based on initial speed, acceleration, and time interval for a motion along a straight line.    
	Parameters:
	initial_speed (int): The initial speed of the moving object in m/s.
	acceleration (int): The rate of change of speed, m/s^2.
	time (int): The time interval during which the acceleration is applied, in seconds.
