def kinematics_calculate_displacement(initial_speed, acceleration, time, rounding=2):
	"""
	Calculate displacement based on initial speed, acceleration, and time interval for a motion along a straight line.    
	Parameters:
	initial_speed: The initial speed of the moving object in m/s.
	acceleration: The rate of change of speed, m/s^2.
	time: The time interval during which the acceleration is applied, in seconds.
	rounding: The number of decimals to round off the result (optional).

	"""
	pass

def kinematics_calculate_final_speed(initial_speed, acceleration, time, rounding=2):
	"""
	Calculate the final speed of an object that starts from an initial speed and then accelerates for a certain duration.    
	Parameters:
	initial_speed: The initial speed of the moving object in m/s.
	acceleration: The rate of change of speed, m/s^2.
	time: The time interval during which the acceleration is applied, in seconds.
	rounding: The number of decimals to round off the result (optional).
