BMI Calculation (Imperial System: 200 lbs, 6’2”)**  \nFor the imperial system, BMI is calculated as:  \n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight (lbs)} \\times 703}{\\text{height (in)}^2} \\]  \n\nGiven: **200 lbs** and **6’2” (74 inches)**  \n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{200 \\times 703}{74^2} \\approx 25.68 \\]  \n\nAgain, I cannot confirm this via the function since it didn’t return results earlier.  \n\n### **Final Summary**  \n- **Lionel Messi’s Net Worth in Euros**: Data unavailable  \n- **LeBron James’s Net Worth in GBP**: Data unavailable  \n- **BMI (85 kg, 180 cm)**: ~26.23 (approximate)  \n- **BMI (200 lbs, 6’2”)**: ~25.68 (approximate)  \n\nI wish I could provide exact values, but the functions did not work as expected.

These dishes are perfect for serving 4 people and can be easily adapted to vegetarian diets.\n\n**New York Weather Consideration:**\nFor July in New York, you should typically expect warm weather (around 75-85°F/24-29°C) with moderate humidity. There's often a chance of afternoon showers in summer, so you might want to check a reliable weather service for the most up-to-date forecast before finalizing outdoor plans.\n\n**Time Difference Note:**\nNew York (EDT) is generally 13 hours behind Tokyo (JST).
